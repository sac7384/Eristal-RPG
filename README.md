# Eristal-RPG
Another personal RPG project using a UI library and some more unique mechanics than my previous RPG projects. This project was started in fall of 2025 to learn about using PyQt6 and continue practicing programming in Python.

I aimed to make this RPG project more interesting than my previous ones. I chose to do this using a positional action system where the player can choose which direction to attack an enemy from.

The early prototypes don't make much use of this system, but I think it will make combat more interactive and strategic once I've implemented more skills and actions that utilize it.

Prototype v1 is pretty bare for now, it has a single battle with random enemies, the ability to gain xp and level up, and a small handful of actions for the player characters and enemies. Menu buttons for saving/loading the game and opening the options menu currently have no functionality. The game will have reached Prototype v2 once it has saving and loading, areas to explore with unique events and battles, and skill trees for the player characters

To run the program simply run the Main.exe file

To play the game you can select New Game to open the game window. Clicking the Characters button will show your character's stats and allow you to increase them by clicking the Stat Points buttons (once you've leveled up and have stat points). Clicking the Battle button will initiate a battle with three random enemies. You can target someone by selecting one of the four buttons surrounding each battle participant and then click one of your character's action buttons to use that action (as long as it is that character's turn). Rose wields a two handed battleaxe that deals damage to the Front of an enemy (the target button on the enemy's left), Oswald can Heal or hold up his shield to take half damage from attacks, Elijah can cast an ice spell that attacks the Front of an enemy and slows them down and a Barrier spell which will block an instance of damage for the targetted character. If you defeat all the enemies you will win the battle and earn some xp, which will allow you to level up your characters once you reach 100.
