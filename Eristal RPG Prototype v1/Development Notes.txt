Eristal kids' skill trees (to be implemented in the future)

Enchanter-enchants skills or gives buffs, maybe bladesinger/aegis as well

Stats
HP
Power (damage increase)
Defense (damage reduction)
Speed (determines turn order)
Luck (crit chance and reduces enemy crit chance)

Starting stats: 5, 1, 1, 1, 1
(Level up increases health by 1)
(Also get 3 points to spend wherever each level)

Damage Formula
(weaponMultiplier * selfPower) - enemyDefense

Crit Formula (this has changed, look in the battle Attack function)
levelDifference = enemyLevel - playerLevel
baseCrit + selfLuck * (selfLuck / (enemyLuck + levelDifference))
#levelDifference is positive if the enemy is a higher level
#Crit modifies attacker's damage

Speed
Turn meter = 10/50/100/500 (based on highest speed value, only for reducing calculations needed)
Each tick entity's speed is added, once it reaches the turn meter it takes a turn
Turn ties are broken based on highest turn meter value, and then highest speed stat, if both are the same then broken based on battle position (top/left entities go first)

XP
levelDifference = enemyLevel - playerLevel
enemyXP * (1 + (levelDifference / 10))
#Each difference in level modifies xp by 10%
#levelDifference is positive if the enemy is a higher level

Current to do list:
Change "Effect Success" to just be for "x effect applied", and "Action Success" can have the action's unique flavor text
Will need to change ApplyEffects in battle window, effect feedback only supports the value of one effect being applied
Make certain effects like Shielded/Barrier have positions in their tags (positionEffectsTags with "EachPosition": {Tags})
^Make sure to change description text for these actions as well
SwapAction button in BattleWindow
Tooltip for each entity in battle which lists all their current effects
Change position strings and enemy targetting strings to constants in GameMenu (and future area code)
Character skill trees
Class for each explorable area, plus a parent Area class
Explore window which handles exploring an area and starting battles/events, instead of the current click Battle and a battle starts
More enemies, actions, effects
Maybe info window with search bar and info on all effects, game mechanics, and tutorial stuff for playing the game
Add pronouns to Entity.py and put a variable in all action descriptor messages for it
"Action Missed": for when an action misses its target, instead of landing and having no effect
"Attack Crit": for when an attack crits, can be a more devestating description, works well with effects that happen on crits also
Add commented out table of contents in each class, or at least some of the longer ones like BattleWindow
See if there is a way to add time delay between enemy turns, without the long stall and not updating time.sleep() caused
Add failure states for some effects/abilities, ie if character is Shielded from Above then can't be slimed by Slime Bubble
